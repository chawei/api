{"text":"This made my day, it\'s giving a personnality to the system i use the most. It is so tired of crawling the web to find me results that it makes typo... it is very human. And the quicktime stuff shows its very lazyness. When computer will make mistakes and have emotions they will be more understood by everybody. I read that somewhere in an old book.","created_at":"Sat Apr 16 12:35:03 +0000 2011","via":"","user":{"profile_image_url":"","screen_name":"","location":"","name":"niclupien "}}, \
{"text":"Google does a lot of interesting stuff, but nothing quite like \"Sloppy Google.\" The project, which is a mash-up of html5 canvas, javascript, processing.js, jQuery, Google Search API, according to the site\'s about page, aims to help people reimagine how the web could work. It's also a lot of fun to see what types of results it comes up with. The modified search engine frequently misspells words, returns random results, and in generally sloppy. The \"hand-drawn\" interface also transforms in odd ways. The lazy google search plays on the concept of a real human being behind the machine, manually doing searches, reports TechCrunch.

{"text":"Sloppy Google freaks me out ....  As a writer/former editor, I cannot stand misspellings or grammatical errors. ...  Is this site supposed to show us that since it would never be acceptable for GOOGLE to get sloppy or lazy, we better not either? ... I\'m probably thinking way too into this. It was just a fun little experiment by some tech-savvy art students, right? I will get back to working very hard now.","created_at":"Sat Apr 16 12:35:03 +0000 2011","via":"","user":{"profile_image_url":"","screen_name":"","location":"","name":"Maressa Brown"}}, \
